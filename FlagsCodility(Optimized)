# this one took me some time to understand
# seeing the composite solution/distance covered sqrt(N) techique took me time and needs more work
# additionally there is an edgecase of there being sqrt(N)+1 flags, that took me a while to see
# the reason this edgecase exists and the -1 is needed @ line 41 is:
# sqrt's are being treated as integers in the loops, but in reality are mostly floats
# so the int(sqrt(35)) value is 5, giving us 5 covers of 5 possible, however thats only a distance of 25 allowing for 10 more blocks to have flags placed
# this gives the sqrt(n)+1
